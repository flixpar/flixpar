I am a PhD student in the [Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University. I am interested in optimization and machine learning, particularly for applications in healthcare and medicine. I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science and Applied Math from Johns Hopkins. Most of my previous work has focused on deep learning and computer vision for biomedical applications.
